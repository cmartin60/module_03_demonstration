## Information
### Sequential
Simply means that statements in a program are executed one after another, in the order they appear.

### Selection
Selection involves making decisions in a program based on certain conditions.
The most common way to implement selection is by using if, elif (else if), and else statements.

### Iteration
Iteration involves repeating a set of statements multiple times.
Python provides two main types of loops: for loop and while loop.
